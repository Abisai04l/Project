			Hello! I am Abisai Arriaza, a young man passionate about computer engineering, physics, astronomy and technologies related to robotics. I am a self-taught person who aspires to be a great physicist and programmer.
			After two years of effort and dedication, I managed to improve my skills and I want to share them with the world. As a lover of programming and free systems, I love Linux and I am excited to show what I can do with it. As a young person from a developing country, I have had to overcome many obstacles to get to where I am today. But thanks to God and my family I was able to reach a more developed place where I could improve my skills and learn new things. My goal is to leave a positive legacy in the world, creating innovative and technological solutions that can help people improve their daily lives. I am committed to my job and always look for ways to improve it and learn new things. If you are looking for a person passionate about technology and robotics, who is willing to work hard to achieve their goals, then you are in the right place. Contact me to talk more about how I can help you!
